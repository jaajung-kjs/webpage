## 🔍 Remaining Components Analysis

### Components Using V2 Hooks Already (No Migration Needed)
- **ProfilePage** - Already using `useProfileV2`
- **CommentSection** - Already using `useCommentsV2`
- **Admin Components** - Most already using V2 hooks

### Low-Priority Components (V1 Hooks Still Present)
- **SettingsPage** - Uses `useProfile` (non-critical, stable)
- **MembersPage** - Uses `useMembers` + `useProfileV2` (partially migrated)
- **MemberManagement** - Uses `useMembers` (admin-only functionality)

**Note**: These remaining components are either admin-only tools or secondary features that can be migrated in a future maintenance cycle without affecting core user experience.
